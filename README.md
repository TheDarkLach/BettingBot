Bot originally made for a minecraft sports league to bet on teams
Based off a bot I found on discord but can't seem to find it anymore for credit :(

basic commands:

- Display a game for betting with live pools

/game [team1] [team2] [description]

- Choose the winner of the game

/resolve [event_id] [result]

- Gain coins everyday

/daily

System that gives players coins every 10 minutes if they talk in the server

Probably some other stuff im forgetting
